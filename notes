Ingestion

poller that populates a database
- get list of services (initially from a small set of CRS, inner london train stations)
- query service within a given range up to the point of departure (when it's departed, the service probably won't be updating with anything we care about)
- OR: use GetDepBoardWithDetails to get service details. Query this a lot, with the time offset 5 minutes in the past?

Ideally, should be able to find a service in the future, even if there isn't any data about it. Maybe have something that populates services on a less regular basis?



Predictor

query mechanism that uses data and finds the likely platform

How should the platform be predicted?
Data inputs:
- platforms used for this service
- platforms used by this service at this time
- platforms used by this service on this day of the week
- platforms that are currently allocated
